/*
Approach: Expand Around Center
Iterate through each character in the string, treating it as the center of a potential palindrome. 
Since palindromes can be of odd or even length, expand outwards from both `i` (single character center) 
and `i, i+1` (two character center) as long as the characters on both sides match. Keep track of the 
maximum length found and calculate the starting and ending indices to extract the longest substring.
